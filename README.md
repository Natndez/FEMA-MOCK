### FEMA Mock Application
<p>FEMA is a government organization that aids in natural disasters. A few years ago there was a catastrophic<br>
hurricane that damaged the lives of many people. FEMA was able to raise a lot of volunteers to help handle the<br>
damage. There was an issue however, while they had a lot of help, FEMA did not have a way to assign various jobs<br>
to the volunteers. I figured it would be a good coding challenge to create a "mock website" for them that<br> 
tracks the below positions as well as their needs.<br></p>

| Login | <br>
-All users must log in, they specify their role when creating an account <br>

| Technologies |<br>
-Flask<br>
-Bootstrap with some personalizations in scss<br>
-Chrome Dev Tools ( The best dev tools :) )<br>

| FEMA | (6-8 hours... need to learn more about databases)<br>
-Input items/jobs into database<br>
-3 databases, items, jobs, and commitments<br>
-Government organization<br>
-Perhaps they should "sign in" if they are an employee<br>

| Distribution Center | (4 Hours)<br>
-Look at items and agree which items to take<br>
-Have providers in the distribution center. <br>
-Distribution center does not have constant inventory, just donations that come and go.<br>
-Have a "ledger" of what donations are present<br>
-When the donations of the essential items (e.g. water, food, clothes, materials to rebuild)<br>
-Have the ability to make a new distribution *<br>

| Drivers | (1 Hour)<br>
-Take items to commitments<br>
-Paid position<br>

| Workers | (1 Hour)<br>
-Jobs go to workers<br>
-Volunteers

| Items | (30 mins - 1 Hour)<br>
-Items that are in the warehouse<br>

| Jobs | (2 Hours)<br>
-List of jobs that need posting<br>
-Have a tally of how many positions are in each location<br>

| Commitments | (1-2 Hours)<br>
-Things that have been committed to be donated but are en route (i.e. someone said they will donate 30 shirts <br>but it'll take time to ship)<br>
-Maybe can be lost in transit? Or maybe not that deep.<br>

| Technical Requirements | (Figuring out how to set each thing up with these requirements will take more time for me...)<br>
-Must be hosted so the site can actually be accessed and save state or something<br>
-Figure out how to set up a "Server"<br>
-May have to grind the odin project to complete this<br>
-Can be one app with multiple different views instead of creating multiple apps that have access to the same database<br>
-Try to have either a log in or just a registration that adds someone to their specific department (e.g. worker, driver, donations, etc.)<br>
-ALL positions must be registered, including the distribution center.<br>


Total theoretical time ~19 hours
